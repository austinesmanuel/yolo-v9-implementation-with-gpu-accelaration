# YOLOv9 Segmentation with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv9 segmentation model with OpenCV to perform real-time object detection and segmentation through a webcam feed. The script loads a pretrained YOLOv9 model, processes the webcam frames, and displays bounding boxes and segmentation masks for detected objects.

## Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the code:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- TorchVision
- Ultralytics YOLO (for YOLOv9 model)

## Installation

### 1. Python Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts. You can create one using the following:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv yolov9-segmentation

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows
yolov9-segmentation\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source yolov9-segmentation/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Required Libraries

To install the necessary packages, run the following commands:

```bash
# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install OpenCV
pip install opencv-python

# Install PyTorch and TorchVision (with CUDA support if available)
# For CUDA 11.7
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

# If you don't have a CUDA-compatible GPU or don't need CUDA:
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# Install Ultralytics YOLO
pip install ultralytics
```

You can also check the [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to ensure you're installing the correct version for your system.

### 3. Download YOLOv9 Segmentation Model

You need to download the YOLOv9 segmentation model weights. You can either download it manually or specify the model path for the YOLO object in the script.

```bash
# Example of downloading the model:
#NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE WHEN THE CODE EXECUTES IT DOWNLOADS THE MODELS SIMULTANEOUSLY IF NEEDED
wget https://path-to-models/yolov9c-seg.pt
```

Place the model in your project directory, or set the path to the model correctly in your Python script.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed and the model is downloaded, you can run the script with the following command:

```bash
python yolov9seg.py
```

This will open a webcam feed and display both bounding boxes and segmentation masks over detected objects in real-time. Press `q` to quit the program.

### Command Line Options

- `device`: Specify whether to run the model on `'cuda'` (GPU) or `'cpu'`. The script automatically detects if CUDA is available.
- `iou_threshold`: Intersection over Union threshold for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), default is `0.5`.

## Explanation of Code

### 1. Loading the Model

```python
model_path = "yolov9c-seg.pt"
model = YOLO(model_path)
```

This line loads the pretrained YOLOv9 segmentation model.

### 2. Device Selection

```python
device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
```

This checks if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available and runs the model on the GPU if possible. Otherwise, it defaults to CPU.

### 3. Frame Processing

```python
ret, frame = cap.read()
frame_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
results = model.predict(frame_rgb, device=device)
```

The frame is read from the webcam and converted from BGR to RGB (as expected by the YOLO model). Then the model performs detection and segmentation on the current frame.

### 4. Handling Detection Results

```python
boxes = det.xyxy.to('cpu')
scores = det.conf.to('cpu')
masks = results[0].masks.data.to('cpu')
```

Bounding boxes, confidence scores, and segmentation masks are extracted. The results are transferred to the CPU for further processing.

### 5. Visualization

```python
cv2.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.putText(frame, label, (x1, y1 - 10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 0.5, (0, 255, 0), 2)
colored_mask = cv2.applyColorMap(mask_resized, cv2.COLORMAP_JET)
frame = cv2.addWeighted(frame, 1, colored_mask, 0.5, 0)
```

The bounding boxes and segmentation masks are drawn on the frame. The mask is resized and colorized using OpenCV's `applyColorMap`, and then blended into the original frame with transparency using `addWeighted`.

## Alternatives and Improvements

### 1. Save Output to Video File

You can modify the script to save the output with both bounding boxes and segmentation masks as a video file:

```python
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output.avi', cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID'), 20, (frame.shape[1], frame.shape[0]))
```

Then, within the loop, write each processed frame:

```python
out.write(frame)
```

### 2. Model Inference on Images

If you're not interested in real-time webcam inference, you can modify the script to work on images. Instead of reading from the webcam, load the image using OpenCV:

```python
frame = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
```

### 3. Batch Processing

For performance improvements, you can modify the script to process multiple frames in batches rather than one at a time. This is particularly useful for video processing.

### 4. Custom Models

If you have a custom YOLOv9 model, you can easily replace the provided model path with your own:

```python
model_path = "path_to_your_custom_model.pt"
```

## Known Issues

- **Segmentation Quality**: The YOLOv9 segmentation model may not provide as fine-grained segmentation as other models like Mask R-CNN. You can experiment with different model weights for improved accuracy.
- **Performance on CPU**: If you're running the model on a CPU, performance might be slower, especially for real-time video processing. Consider using a GPU for faster inference.
